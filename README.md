GrowZucchini is a modular automation system for indoor plant environments, built with Arduino and Python. It supports
monitoring and control of key environmental factors, including:

- Climate And Soil Moisture Control.
- Data Logging & Visualization: Backed by InfluxDB, enabling time-series data storage and interactive dashboard
  visualization through its built-in UI.
- Modular Architecture: Structured around interchangeable sensor and actuator modules (e.g., alarms, lights, pumps).
  Devices can be added or removed by plugging them into well-defined integration points, without altering the systemâ€™s
  core logic. The core of the system is generic and reusable across Arduino-based setups, supporting any combination of
  devices for any purpose.
- Python Control App: Receives sensor data from Arduino, makes control decisions, sends commands to actuators. CLI-based
  manual overrides is supported.
- Dockerized Deployment: Python app and InfluxDB run in isolated containers for portability and stability.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Python application (`growzucchini`) that communicates with embedded devices, controls actuators, and logs data
  to InfluxDB.
- `arduino/`: PlatformIO-based firmware for Arduino-compatible boards, responsible for reading sensors and receiving
  control commands.
- `Makefile`: Unification of dev commands across both environments.
